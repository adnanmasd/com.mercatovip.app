MercatoVIP APP

Mercatovip is a online ecommerce platform serving fashion industry. This project is for the Hybrid Mobile application for the brand which can run on iOS and Android both with the same code base.
The technologies used in the project are : 

    1. Apache Cordova (for compiling native source code for iOS and Android)
    2. Webpack (for building the source code)
    3. Framework7 with VueJS (provides the native UI/UX components)
    4. Github (for versioning)
    5. OneSignal (for Push Notifications)
    6. Axios (for communication with the server based on AJAX)
    
Unfortunately, the project is closed and the servers no longer serve the application data hence the app will show black screen upon running.
